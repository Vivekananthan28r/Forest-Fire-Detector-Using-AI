Forest Fire Detector using Ai
Project Overview
This project is designed to detect fire and smoke using the YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once) object detection model. It processes images and videos to identify potential fire hazards in real-time. The dataset used for training was manually created and labeled to ensure accurate detection.

Key Features
Real-time Fire and Smoke Detection: The system can identify fire and smoke in images and video feeds.

Custom Dataset: The dataset was built from scratch, with images manually labeled for training the YOLOv4 model.

YOLOv4-Based Model: Utilizes YOLOv4â€™s efficient object detection algorithm for accurate and fast predictions.

Non-Commercial Use: This project is intended for research and learning purposes and is not optimized for commercial deployment.

Dataset Creation and Labeling
The dataset includes images of fire and smoke from various scenarios.

Images were manually annotated using tools like LabelImg to create bounding boxes for fire and smoke.

The labeled dataset was then converted into the YOLO format for training.

Implementation Details
Programming Language: Python

Frameworks/Libraries Used:

OpenCV (for image processing)

Darknet (YOLOv4 framework)

NumPy and Pandas (data handling)

Matplotlib (visualization)
